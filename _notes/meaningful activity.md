# Meaningful activity
Currently, the meaningful user activities are:
- reading an article
- answering a question
- viewing an ANKI card (--> **need to clarify**)

This list might change in the future.

This means, for example, that a user who logs into AMBOSS and only performs a search (without reading an article) is not considered *active* and is not counted towards the [[📐 DAU]], [[📐 WAU]], [[📐 MAU]] metrics.

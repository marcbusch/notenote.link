# 📐 individual paid access
Definition:
>Users with **individual paid access** have an active subscription.

## Data
field: `accessv2_access_type = 'individual'`

## Need to clarify
- counting users with individual paid access in active_user_accounts and user_profile leads to different numbers --> investigate

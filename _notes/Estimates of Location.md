# Estimates of Location
- [[Mean]] (and trimmed mean)
- [[Median]]
- [[Mode]]

The median and trimmed mean are robust estimates of location, i.e. they are insensitive to [[Outlier|outliers]].

There are more estimates of location (or [central tendencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_tendency)). But for medium and large data sets, the above mentioned estimates are all that's needed.
